# Getting started with Python is a great idea, as it's a versatile and beginner-friendly programming language. 
### Here's a step-by-step tutorial [Codes With Pankaj ](https://www.codeswithpankaj.com) on how to install Python and get started with your first program:

### Step 1: Install Python

1. **Download Python:**
   - Visit the official Python website: [Python Downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
   - The website should automatically suggest the latest version suitable for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux). Click on the "Download" button.

2. **Run the Installer:**
   - For Windows: Run the downloaded executable file and follow the installation wizard's instructions.
   - For macOS: Open the downloaded `.pkg` file and follow the installation instructions.
   - For Linux: Python is often pre-installed. If not, use your package manager (e.g., `apt` for Ubuntu) to install Python.

3. **Check Installation:**
   - Open a command prompt (Windows) or terminal (macOS/Linux).
   - Type `python --version` or `python3 --version` and press Enter. You should see the installed Python version.

### Step 2: Set Up a Development Environment

1. **Text Editor or IDE:**
   - Choose a code editor or integrated development environment (IDE). Some popular choices include:
     - VSCode
     - PyCharm
     - Atom
     - Sublime Text
     - IDLE (comes with Python)

### Step 3: Write Your First Python Program

1. **Open Your Text Editor/IDE:**
   - Launch your chosen editor or IDE.

2. **Create a New File:**
   - Open a new file in your editor.

3. **Write Your First Program:**
   - Type the following simple Python program:
     ```python
     print("Hello, Python!")
     ```

4. **Save the File:**
   - Save the file with a `.py` extension, for example, `first_program.py`.

5. **Run the Program:**
   - Open a terminal or command prompt in the same directory where you saved your Python file.
   - Type `python first_program.py` (or `python3 first_program.py` on some systems) and press Enter.
   - You should see the output: `Hello, Python!`

Congratulations! You've successfully installed Python, set up a development environment, and written and executed your first Python program.

### Step 4: Learn and Explore

1. **Official Python Documentation:**
   - Explore the [Python Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/).

2. **Tutorials and Online Courses:**
   - Utilize online platforms like Codecademy, Coursera, or edX for structured Python courses.

3. **Practice and Experiment:**
   - Try solving coding challenges on platforms like HackerRank or LeetCode.
   - Build small projects to apply your knowledge.

Remember that programming is a skill that improves with practice, so keep coding and have fun exploring the world of Python!
