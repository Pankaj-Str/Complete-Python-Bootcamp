# Python Comments

#### Introduction:
Welcome to CodesWithPankaj.com! In this tutorial, we'll explore the importance of comments in Python programming. Comments are essential for documenting your code, making it more readable, and helping others (or even yourself) understand your thought process. Let's dive into the world of Python comments!

#### Types of Comments:

Python supports two types of comments:

1. **Single-line comments:** These comments are created using the `#` symbol and are used for commenting on a single line.

   Example:
   ```python
   # This is a single-line comment
   print("Hello, Python!")
   ```

2. **Multi-line comments (Docstrings):** These comments span multiple lines and are enclosed within triple-quotes (`'''` or `"""`). They are often used as docstrings to provide documentation for functions, modules, or classes.

   Example:
   ```python
   '''
   This is a multi-line comment (docstring).
   It provides documentation for the following function.
   '''

   def my_function():
       """This is also a docstring for the function."""
       print("Doing something...")
   ```

#### Best Practices for Using Comments:

1. **Be Clear and Concise:**
   - Clearly explain complex sections or algorithms.
   - Avoid unnecessary comments that merely restate the code.

2. **Update Comments Regularly:**
   - Keep comments up-to-date with code changes.
   - Outdated comments can lead to confusion.

3. **Use Descriptive Variable and Function Names:**
   - Well-named variables and functions reduce the need for excessive comments.

4. **Docstrings for Functions and Classes:**
   - Include docstrings to describe the purpose, parameters, and return values of functions and classes.

#### Example Code with Comments:

Now, let's enhance a simple Python script with comments to explain the code:

```python
# codeswithpankaj_comments.py

# This script calculates the sum of two numbers

# Function to add two numbers
def add_numbers(a, b):
    """
    This function takes two parameters and returns their sum.
    :param a: The first number
    :param b: The second number
    :return: The sum of a and b
    """
    result = a + b
    return result

# Input values
num1 = 5
num2 = 7

# Calculate the sum using the function
sum_result = add_numbers(num1, num2)

# Display the result
print(f"The sum of {num1} and {num2} is: {sum_result}")
```

#### Conclusion:

Comments play a vital role in making your code more understandable and maintainable. By incorporating comments effectively, you contribute to a collaborative coding environment.
