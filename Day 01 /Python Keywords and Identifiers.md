# Python Keywords and Identifiers

#### Introduction:
Welcome to CodesWithPankaj.com! In this tutorial, we'll explore Python keywords and identifiersâ€”essential concepts for understanding Python programming. Whether you're a beginner or looking to reinforce your knowledge, let's dive in.

#### Python Keywords:

Keywords are reserved words in Python that have specific meanings and cannot be used as identifiers (variable names, function names, etc.). Here's a table of Python keywords:

|       |       |        |       |        |
|-------|-------|--------|-------|--------|
| False | class | finally| is    | return |
| None  | continue | for  | lambda| try    |
| True  | def   | from   | nonlocal | while|
| and   | del   | global | not   | with   |
| as    | elif  | if     | or    | yield  |
| assert| else  | import | pass  |        |
| break | except| in     | raise |        |

Feel free to reference this table whenever you encounter a keyword in your Python code.

#### Identifiers:

Identifiers are names given to variables, functions, classes, etc. They follow certain rules:

- Must start with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore (_).
- Can be followed by letters, underscores, and digits (0-9).
- Case-sensitive.

Examples of valid identifiers: `my_variable`, `_count`, `Total2`.

#### Creating Identifiers:

Now, let's write a simple Python script to demonstrate the creation of identifiers:

```python
# codeswithpankaj_identifiers.py

# Valid identifiers
my_variable = 42
_count = 10
Total2 = 100

# Invalid identifiers - Uncommenting these lines will result in an error
# 2nd_variable = 20  # starts with a digit
# my-variable = 5     # contains a hyphen
# class = "Python"    # keyword used as an identifier

# Displaying values
print("Valid Identifiers:")
print("my_variable =", my_variable)
print("_count =", _count)
print("Total2 =", Total2)

# Uncommenting the next line will result in an error
# print("2nd_variable =", 2nd_variable)
```

This script demonstrates valid and invalid identifiers. Uncomment the invalid lines to observe the errors they produce.

#### Conclusion:

Understanding Python keywords and identifiers is crucial for writing clean, error-free code. Now that you've grasped these concepts, you're well on your way to becoming a proficient Python coder!
