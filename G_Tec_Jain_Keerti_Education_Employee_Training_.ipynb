        "\n",
        "### Step 1: Install Python\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Download Python:**\n",
        "   - Visit the official Python website: [Python Downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/).\n",
        "   - The website should automatically suggest the latest version suitable for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux). Click on the \"Download\" button.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Run the Installer:**\n",
        "   - For Windows: Run the downloaded executable file and follow the installation wizard's instructions.\n",
        "   - For macOS: Open the downloaded `.pkg` file and follow the installation instructions.\n",
        "   - For Linux: Python is often pre-installed. If not, use your package manager (e.g., `apt` for Ubuntu) to install Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Check Installation:**\n",
        "   - Open a command prompt (Windows) or terminal (macOS/Linux).\n",
        "   - Type `python --version` or `python3 --version` and press Enter. You should see the installed Python version.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Step 2: Set Up a Development Environment\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Text Editor or IDE:**\n",
        "   - Choose a code editor or integrated development environment (IDE). Some popular choices include:\n",
        "     - VSCode\n",
        "     - PyCharm\n",
        "     - Atom\n",
        "     - Sublime Text\n",
        "     - IDLE (comes with Python)\n",
        "\n",
        "### Step 3: Write Your First Python Program\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Open Your Text Editor/IDE:**\n",
        "   - Launch your chosen editor or IDE.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Create a New File:**\n",
        "   - Open a new file in your editor.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Write Your First Program:**\n",
        "   - Type the following simple Python program:\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     print(\"Hello, Python!\")\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Save the File:**\n",
        "   - Save the file with a `.py` extension, for example, `first_program.py`.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Run the Program:**\n",
        "   - Open a terminal or command prompt in the same directory where you saved your Python file.\n",
        "   - Type `python first_program.py` (or `python3 first_program.py` on some systems) and press Enter.\n",
        "   - You should see the output: `Hello, Python!`\n",
        "\n",
        "Congratulations! You've successfully installed Python, set up a development environment, and written and executed your first Python program.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Step 4: Learn and Explore\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Official Python Documentation:**\n",
        "   - Explore the [Python Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/).\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Tutorials and Online Courses:**\n",
        "   - Utilize online platforms like Codecademy, Coursera, or edX for structured Python courses.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Practice and Experiment:**\n",
        "   - Try solving coding challenges on platforms like HackerRank or LeetCode.\n",
        "   - Build small projects to apply your knowledge.\n",
        "\n",

        "#### Introduction:\n",

        "#### Types of Comments:\n",
        "\n",
        "Python supports two types of comments:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Single-line comments:** These comments are created using the `#` symbol and are used for commenting on a single line.\n",
        "\n",
        "   Example:\n",
        "   ```python\n",

        "   print(\"Hello, Python!\")\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Multi-line comments (Docstrings):** These comments span multiple lines and are enclosed within triple-quotes (`'''` or `\"\"\"`). They are often used as docstrings to provide documentation for functions, modules, or classes.\n",

        "   Example:\n",

        "The `break` and `continue` statements are powerful tools for controlling the flow of loops in Python. While `break` allows you to exit a loop prematurely, `continue` lets you skip the remaining code for the current iteration and move on to the next one. These statements contribute to writing cleaner and more efficient code.\n",
